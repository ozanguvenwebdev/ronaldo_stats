# Ronaldo Regression Analysis 
 This is a web scraping, data science and analysis project written in python to analyse statistics of Ronaldo. I wanted to do this project because I thought that it will be good to start my data science journey with sports analysis, and of course, Ronaldo is a legend and I thought that it would be an interesting topic.
 The research includes the seasons from 2002-2003 to 2019-2020. In these seasons, we know the number of goals, assists he made, and cards he had etc. I analysed the change of these values with respect to year (or his age).

### First Part: Collecting Data
