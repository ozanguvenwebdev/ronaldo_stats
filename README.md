# Ronaldo Regression Analysis 
 This is a web scraping, data science and analysis project written in python to analyse statistics of Ronaldo. I wanted to do this project because I thought that it will be good to start my data science journey with sports analysis, and of course, Ronaldo is a legend and I thought that it would be an interesting topic.
 The research includes the seasons from 2002-2003 to 2019-2020. In these seasons, we know the number of goals, assists he made, and cards he had etc. I analysed the change of these values with respect to year (or his age).

### First Part: Collecting Data
 I found a website which has statistics of Ronaldo (https://fbref.com/en/players/dea698d9/Cristiano-Ronaldo). Then, I used beautifulsoup to scrap the numerical info from the HTML.
After scrapping data, I turned it into a CSV file and started to analyze it.

### Second Part: Analysis
 Because there are no so many parameters, I generally investigated the change of the values with respect to his age. There is an obscene incline in the number of his goals and assists. In the last part, additively, I tried to find a correlation btw the number of his goals and assists.
